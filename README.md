# Java-Program
Write a function that takes in a non-empty array of distinct integers and an integer representing a target sum, The function should find all triplets in the array that sum up to the target sum and print all the triplets. The numbers in each triptlet should be ordered in ascending order, and the triplets themselves should be ordered in ascending order with respect to the numbers triplets.  If no three number sum, the function should return an empty array.  Input = [8,10,-2,49,14]  Target sum : 57  Output: [[10,-2,49]]
